## 🔧 Technical Details

### AI Algorithm
The recommendation engine uses a **rule-based AI system** that:
1. Analyzes student metrics (attendance, grades, behavior, risk score)
2. Identifies specific problem areas
3. Matches problems to evidence-based interventions
4. Prioritizes actions based on urgency
5. Generates personalized recommendations

### Data Inputs
- Attendance percentage
- Average grade percentage
- Behavioral score (1-10)
- Overall risk score (0-1)

### Recommendation Logic
```
IF attendance < 70% THEN
  - Add attendance intervention
  - Suggest transportation support
  - Recommend barrier identification

IF avgGrade < 70% THEN
  - Add academic support plan
  - Suggest tutoring program
  - Recommend study skills workshop

IF behavioralScore < 6 THEN
  - Add behavioral assessment
  - Suggest motivational interviewing
  - Recommend mental health counseling

IF riskScore >= 0.7 THEN
  - Priority = CRITICAL
  - Add emergency interventions
  - Urgent parent conference
  - Crisis intervention protocol
```
